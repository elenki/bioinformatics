# $SET$ $THEORY$ Bascis

* $Set$ means a collection of objects with a common property, irrespective of the order in which they are listed. It is denoted by capital letters.
    * $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ $ = \{x | x \in \mathbb{N}, 1 \leq x \leq 5\}$

* These objects are called $elements$ or $members$ of the set. $elements$ are denoted by small letters.
    * $1 \in A$
    * $6 \notin A$

* Two sets are equal if they have the same elements.
    * $A = B \iff \forall x, x \in A \iff x \in B$
    * Non-equal sets are denoted by $\neq$

* $empty$ $set$ or $null$ $set$ is a set with no elements. It is denoted by $\emptyset$ or $\{\}$.

* $universal$ $set$ is a set of all possible elements. It is denoted by $\mathbb{U}$.

* $subset$ is a set whose elements are all contained in another set. It is denoted by $\subset$ or $\subseteq$.
    * $A \subseteq B \iff \forall x, x \in A \implies x \in B$
    * $A \subset B \iff \forall x, x \in A \implies x \in B \land \exists y, y \in B \land y \notin A$
